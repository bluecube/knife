This is my experimental key chain knife design.

The main goals:

- Not too large, not too heavy
- Blade should be as long as possible
- Clip on the key chain _easilly_ when not in use
- Locking (ideally both opened and closed)
- Beer opener

I managed to fit most of the goals into it.
The last version (in branch `framelock`) drops locking in the closed
position for simpler and thinner and better lock.

So far one iteration of the knife was built (tagged as `mark1`),
more or less according to the model (handle from aluminium and without the beer opener) ...
... And it works :-) It's a bit dull and wobbly, but the problem here are IMO my hands, not the design :-)
