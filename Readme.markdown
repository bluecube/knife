This is my experimental key chain knife design.

The main goals:

- Not too large, not too heavy
- Blade should be as long as possible
- Clip on the key chain _easilly_ when not in use
- Locking (ideally both opened and closed)
- Beer opener

This branch is even more experimental than the rest,
contains a knife that opens by sliding instead of pivoting (or what it's called).

No images yet.
To see something at least a little realistic try the branch framelock
(which I'll probably be building pretty soon), or tag mark1 (which I've already built).
